Hey no fair to those of us already vaccinated! Yes yes I’m whining.
What about us in March? I WANT A BEER
Also I don’t drink lol.
Can I get revaxxed?
YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME
But what about all of us who got vaccinated already?
"Answer the important questions, WHAT ABOUT US ALREADY VAXXED????"
South jersey forgotten again.
Bribes 
Are we now all children?
You should retroactively apply this to those of us already vaccinated!
Can I get vaccinated again for the free beer?? 
People are actually complaining about this. So what if you “missed out”? We’re adults. Let’s just do what we have to do to get everyone vaccinated!
How about a “Shot and toss mask in Trash”
"I am signing up for a""first"" vaccine for the rest of the month.   Thanks Murph for the beer."
We want 8ths

What about those who got their vaccine earlier?
This is so cool!!! Great job Governor Murphy
"BEST.
STATE.
EVER."
" 

Here’s a good idea...."
Wisconsin needs to do this
 great things come to those who wait Breanna…  
what if I already got mine?!
Do you have to double mask when you get your beer?
"Hope someone pays for all the beer these establishments are giving away, maybe more federal bailout $."
All of us who got vaxxed before May should get two beers
"""Free beer? You'll never get New Jerseyeans to do something just because of free beer."" ---Larry Kudlow"
So what bout the ppl who got it in April ??
End criminal and civil penalties for home cannabis cultivation
"I wouldn't pick beer to go with my Krispy Kreme donut, but YMMV."
BRILLIANT!!!
Cc 
Nice !
Hey Gov there are great breweries in South Jersey. Can you get some on the list?
Is it possible to get the first vaccine shot multiple times?
 where you at?
oh hey  is this available retroactively?? asking for a friend
"According to NJ law, you cannot sell any alcohol below cost.  Wonder how this works? Are the bars participating keeping track and billing the state for it?"
How bout a backwood
Yo Murph if we already got the shots can we still get a free beer from one of these breweries?
"Donuts, beer, whisky, what’s next a free bottle of oxy?"
America!
"Give 5 Lottery tickets to everyone who gets vaccinated. Goodbye, COVID."
 let's do it
Seriously?  Offer me a car and I’ll think about it.
what if you already got your shots? 
Interesting....take a shot to save your own life and we have to give you free beer . This is crazy. 
"Um, you do know alcohol suppress the immune system, right?"
Love this! Can we get other NJ food industries to participate?
"Now we need a Don't Ask, Don't Tell campaign for Republicans."
Bruh where are the bars in hudson county? Where's my free beer?
 dang it. should have waited
You should hand out free Strandberg guitars for vaccinations
This cannot be real I hate it here
How about extending it to those that were vaccinated earlier .
loooooooooool
Wow!!! What an incentive!!
Crap. I should've waited a day. Lol
Love it...
RIVERHORSE!!!  LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
Who’s driving them Governor ??
Shot and a joint would be more effective for side effects - pass on the shot until we can pass the joint!  
"Hmm, wonder where they got this idea? "
What else can we get people to do for a free beer!?! 
Well if this isn’t pay to play...
this should be money
Hahahahahahahahah what a joke  thoughts on this?????
What if you’ve been fully vaccinated for a month 
Notice how many of these are in redder areas of the state. 
"I'm of the ""whatever works"" belief. My only critique is that it will encourage people to go to bars before they're protected by the vaccine."
Give the intern who came up with this a job!
"Hey, I’m all for this but how about some love for those of us who already got vaccinated because it’s the right thing to do?  Also, happy to see Flying Fish (about a mile from my home) on the list, but I’m sure more South Jersey breweries would sign on."
What about the rule that breweries can't give away free beer?!
"I think it should be ""a shot and a slice [of pizza]."" That way teens could participate too."
" pizza is the state national food, bribery with pizza is always an A+"
"Your move, Bada Bing"
I would offer a free beer if you choose to remain “unvaccinated”…. Although to each his/her own
Lmao wow
"May 3NEW: We’re launching our “Shot and a Beer” program to encourage eligible New Jerseyans ages 21+ to get vaccinated.

Any New Jerseyan who gets their first vaccine dose in the month of May and takes their vaccination card to a participating brewery will receive a free beer. "
"This is just so funny, so damn funny."
Brilliant 
"Can I fly in and become a New Jerseyan for multiple shots/beers from Wales this seems like a good plan, I would like to take part there. :)"
FYI our(Indian) politicians have been distributing free alcohol before elections since long.
This is fucked
Can you change it to after they get their second shot since people seem to be skipping that?
 Why can't we bring this to Delaware
Y’all trying so hard to pump this bs into people 
Great promotion! Fun.
"Take it a step further: No shootie, no booty.Selling Vaccination — RomanticallySelling Vaccination — RomanticallyLet's tell the vaccine-hesitant they’re not boyfriend materialLet's tell the vaccine-hesitant they’re not boyfriend material"
I have vaccination of second dose too will I get a free beer in my near by brewery ??
Uh that is against the law to entice people to drink. Bars can lose liquor licenses for doing these things
This could be a bad play for drinking and driving no? I guess Uber is still around and being used.
Don't make me go to a brewery. Just give me the beer right there at the vaccination site.
I will only get vaccinated if you give me a $100 DraftKings gift card
Bravo. This is brilliant.
No surprise that your incentive has to do with alcohol.   God help us
I got my first dose in April. DAMNIT.
So now you want folks to go get drunk after their shot??? 
Hey  let’s do this
"I got mine, too. Where is my beer"
What about if you got it in April???
"Yeah, that seems healthy!"
i miss NJ
If Covid doesn't kill you the alcohol poisoning will...  nice
Yo  where's my free beer?
 because 
Hi 
So only the slackers qualify? How about some love those who got out early
 I don't think ppl should be bribed with alcohol to get a vaccine.
Man of the people.
Shouldn’t people that didn’t need to be bribed to get the shot get the free beer?
Open the bars
"Oh man.. I got my first dose just last week. I want a beer. Lol!  On a serious note, THANK YOU!"
And what about April?
"People, if you already got vaccinated you did it for yourself, your family and to save the planet. Enjoy that! And buy your own beer."
"Already got the JNJ, but I'll double up for a free beer"
Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) announces the “Shot and a Beer” program to encourage eligible residents ages 21+ to get vaccinated.0:310:3152K viewsThe RecountThe RecountThe Recount
This is a joke right?!
If I get a DUI will you pardon me?
NJ friends - there are lots of good reasons to get vaccinated. A free 1920's Lager at Gaslight in South Orange is surely one of them.
All I got were free samples from Costco after getting my shots there. 
Dang it!  What about us good citizens that already did our duty?????
I’m guessing “Shot and an Edible” got held up in the state Senate?
Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ) announces the “Shot and a Beer” program to encourage eligible residents ages 21+ to get vaccinated.
This is pretty fun actually
What if we already got ours
 you guys should get in on this if it’s within reason operationally.
y not bong hit
I'd rather get SHOT & a SHOT  ... not everyone drinks beer...
Awesome idea!
Cuándo te sobra la vacuna y ya no sabes que hacer para que se vacunen
The state should give everyone that gets vaccinated a $100 Visa card - would save many lives  and make it safer for society to socialize- more people would get vaccinated with a financial incentive
"Take note, . Free beer > savings bonds"
Anyway to expand this retroactively? I get my 2nd dose next week and could sure use a drink after ! 
"But... but... I didn’t get a beer!  Oh wait, I’m gluten intolerant... this is discriminatory against those of us with delicate colons! "
what if I got it in march
. can you hook up a march/april guy? I've been itching to come back.
" C’mon Guvnor, do something similar"
Good luck drinking that beer through a mask
Holy shit I hate this guy
SOB...this is the only time I wish I lived in NJ!
"Yeah get your shot then go to a bar so you can drive drunk then kill someone on your way home, great idea "
I don’t drink.
Getting rid of the mask mandate would be a huge incentive. You can keep the beer.
 I’m not sure if your more on the jersey or Penn side but this is so sick lol
These replies are funnier if you say them with a Jersey accent and throw in the occasional f-bomb.
"Ah, the participation trophy era....ridiculous."
wow i just missed the mark lmao got mine in april
Phil is boozepilled 
"Whoa, hold up a minute.  How about those of us vaccinated in April can we be grandfathered into the program"
Noting in jersey city or Hoboken!
That’s good photo op Phil now you are promoting drinking and driving
 Need NC to follow this lead.
"If you played your cards right, you could easily do 3-4 free beers from this."
Can you find a place around Cherry Hill... I got my vaccination card ready 
This is corny
Love it
"I’ll get it if you give away a free   My life, as well as my husband’s and our 3 daughters lives. is worth a lot more valuable than a beer."
"Aw damn, got mine in March. But having the vaccine is 1000% worth it beer or not. Hopefully this is a good incentive for New Jerseyans that are on the fence to go for it and get the shot asap. Plus I've heard good things about a lot of these breweries "
What if I don’t like beer? Can I get a free glass of Pinot Grigio?
I like it
"I just made 15 appointments, going to get turnt up"
I will take a  Head High please.
Go risk putting unknown medicine into your body and get a free $4 beer!!! YEAH THIS IS SO SMART.....
Throw in a bourbon and you have a decent George Thorogood cover song…
No more lollipops ?
Should be for All New Jerseyans who got vaccinated. Why punish those who got vaccinated before May
"I got my shot in April so I'm not eligible.Here's a thought for the rest of you: 

Get a bunch of friends together, get vaccinated in May, rent a party bus, and do a brewery crawl from participating brewery to participating brewery..."
"So....this is all for our health, right? Ok "
this is the most New Jersey thing of all time
Why is Dictator Murphy politicizing Covid shots by giving free beers to anyone getting their shots??? . Is he buying votes with shots and beers for his next election???  Hmmm ... when voting ... voters remember Guvvy gave me a free beer!!! 
Does it work for the second shot..please ?
How is it not a shot for a shot?? Jiminey.
all of us:  How quickly can I sell and relocate?
"Nothing for those of us that took advantage (received no. 2 yesterday) and paved way for remainder of population? Then again, only one SJ brewery on the list. NJ = North Jersey."
"I propose you get them drunk first. We they start slurring Gill Bates over and over, they're ready for their vaccine."
