# Introduction
In December 2020, the polling company Ipsos surveyed adults in 15 countries about whether they intended to get vaccinated. In some countries, the findings were not encouraging. Only 12% of French respondents “strongly” agreed with the statement, “If a vaccine for Covid-19 were available, I would get it.” Only 40% agreed overall. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other global health bodies, vaccine hesitancy is a nuanced concept that describes people who, for various reasons, wait to accept or refuse to take a vaccine even when it is available to them. In order to tackle vaccine hestiancy, some US states, for example, offer lottery tickets and free beer to adults who get vaccinated. These kinds of creative incentives might help nudge vaccine receptive or vaccine neutral adults. There is growing evidence that incentives do motivate those who are either reluctant to get a shot or just haven’t gotten around to it. Our focus is to use the expert.ai API to analyze and visualize how people respond about such **#vaccine-incentives** on Twitter.

# How we Built NLP Vaccine Analysis
We started off with an active brainstorm session regarding how we can effectively use the expert.ai API and came up with an idea of analyzing the tweets on Vaccine incentives.
Data Collection: We have scraped from twitter to obtain the tweets using selenium webscraper, performed text cleaning 
Results: Using expert.ai API for sentiment analysis
Web Application: flask
